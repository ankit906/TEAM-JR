<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The constitution is considered federal in nature, and unitary in spirit. It has features of a federation, including a codified, supreme constitution; a three-tier governmental structure (central, state and local); division of powers; bicameralism; and an independent judiciary. It also possesses unitary features such as a single constitution, single citizenship, an integrated judiciary, a flexible constitution, a strong central government, appointment of state governors by the central government, All India Services (the IAS, IFS and IPS), and emergency provisions. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form.
</p>

<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Each state and union territory has its own government. Analogous to the president and prime minister, each has a governor or (in union territories) a lieutenant governor and a chief minister. Article 356 permits the president to dismiss a state government and assume direct authority if a situation arises in which state government cannot be conducted in accordance with constitution. This power, known as president's rule, was abused as state governments came to be dismissed on flimsy grounds for political reasons. After the S. R. Bommai v. Union of India decision, such a course of action is more difficult since the courts have asserted their right of review.

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Main article: Basic structure doctrine
</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, the Supreme Court ruled that an amendment cannot destroy what it seeks to modify; it cannot tinker with the constitution's basic structure or framework, which are immutable. Such an amendment will be declared invalid, although no part of the constitution is protected from amendment; the basic structure doctrine does not protect any one provision of the constitution. According to the doctrine, the constitution's basic features (when "read as a whole") cannot be abridged or abolished. These "basic features" have not been fully defined,[66] and whether a particular provision of the constitution is a "basic feature" is decided by the courts.
</p>

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">The Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala decision laid down the constitution's basic structure:
</h2>

<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~Supremacy of the constitution</h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~Republican, democratic form of government </h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~Its secular nature </h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~Separation of powers </h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~Its federal character </h2>

<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">This implies that Parliament can only amend the constitution to the limit of its basic structure. The Supreme Court or a high court may declare the amendment null and void if this is violated, after a judicial review. This is typical of parliamentary governments, where the judiciary checks parliamentary power. </p>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">In its 1967 Golak Nath v. State of Punjab decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Punjab could not restrict any fundamental rights protected by the basic structure doctrine.[74] The extent of land ownership and practice of a profession, in this case, were considered fundamental rights. The ruling was overturned with the ratification of the 24th Amendment in 1971.
</p>



<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">The Judiciary</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The judiciary is the final arbiter of the constitution. Its duty (mandated by the constitution) is to act as a watchdog, preventing any legislative or executive act from overstepping constitutional bounds. The judiciary protects the fundamental rights of the people (enshrined in the constitution) from infringement by any state body, and balances the conflicting exercise of power between the central government and a state (or states).
</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The courts are expected to remain unaffected by pressure exerted by other branches of the state, citizens or interest groups. An independent judiciary has been held as a basic feature of the constitution, which cannot be changed by the legislature or the executive. Article 50 of the Constitution provides that the state must take measures to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services.
</p>

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Judicial Review</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Judicial review was adopted by the constitution of India from judicial review in the United States. In the Indian constitution, judicial review is dealt with in Article 13. The constitution is the supreme power of the nation, and governs all laws. According to Article 13:
</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">1. pre-constitutional laws, if they conflict wholly or in part with the constitution, shall have all conflicting provisions deemed ineffective until an amendment to the constitution ends the conflict; the law will again come into force if it is compatible with the constitution as amended (the Doctrine of Eclipse).
  Laws made after the adoption of the constitution must be compatible with it, or they will be deemed void ab initio.
  In such situations, the Supreme Court (or a high court) determines if a law is in conformity with the constitution. If such an interpretation is not possible because of inconsistency (and where separation is possible), the provision which is inconsistent with the constitution is considered void. In addition to Article 13, Articles 32, 226 and 227 provide the constitutional basis for judicial review.
  Due to the adoption of the Thirty-eighth Amendment, the Supreme Court was not allowed to preside over any laws adopted during a state of emergency which infringe fundamental rights under article 32 (the right to constitutional remedies). The Forty-second Amendment widened Article 31C and added Articles 368(4) and 368(5), stating that any law passed by Parliament could not be challenged in court. The Supreme Court ruled in Minerva Mills v. Union of India that judicial review is a basic characteristic of the constitution, overturning Articles 368(4), 368(5) and 31C.
  Dismissal of the Prime Minister
  Despite the President's mandate to obey the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council, Article 75 declares that both "shall hold office during the pleasure of the President." This means the President has the constitutional power to dismiss the Prime Minister or Council at anytime. If the Prime Minister still retained a majority vote in the Lok Sabha, however, this could trigger a constitutional crisis because the same article of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and must command a majority in it. In practice the issue has never arisen, though President Zail Singh threatened to remove Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi from office in 1987

  <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Main article: Federalism in India
  </h2>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The first article of the Constitution declares that India is a "Union of States". Under the Constitution, the States retain key powers for themselves and have a strong influence over the national government via the Rajya Sabha. However, the Constitution does provide key limits on their powers and gives final say in many cases to the national government.</p>



  <span class="inline-block py-1 px-2 rounded bg-indigo-50 text-orange-500 text-xs font-small tracking-widest">State powers in the Constitution
  </span>
  <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Main article: Rajya Sabha
  </h2>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">At the Union level, the States are represented in the Rajya Sabha or Council of States. The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution lays out the number of seats that each State controls in the Council of States, and they are based roughly on each State's population. The members of each state legislature elect and appoint these representatives in the Council of States.[103] On most topics the Rajya Sabha is coequal with the lower house or Lok Sabha, and its consent is required for a bill to become a law.[104] Additionally, as one of the Houses of Parliament, any amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha to go into effect.These provisions allow the States significant impact on national politics through their representation in the "federal chamber".
  </p>

  <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">State List</h2>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The Constitution provides the States with a long list of powers exclusive to their jurisdiction. Generally only State Legislatures are capable of passing laws implementing these powers; the Union government is prohibited from doing so. These powers are contained in the second list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, known as the State List. The areas on the State List are wide-ranging and include topics like public health and order and a variety of taxes. The State List grants the states control over the police, healthcare, agriculture, elections, and more.
  </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Powers can only be permanently removed from the State List via a constitutional amendment approved by a majority of the states. The Rajya Sabha, as the representative of the States, can temporarily remove an item from the State List so the Union parliament can legislate on it. This requires a two-thirds vote and lasts for a renewable one-year period.
  </p>

  <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Amendments</h2>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">In addition to exerting influence over the amendment process via the Rajya Sabha, the States are sometimes involved in the amendment process. This special, entrenched process is triggered when an amendment to the Constitution specifically concerns the States by modifying the legislature or the powers reserved to the states in the Seventh Schedule. When this occurs, an amendment must be ratified by a majority of state legislatures for the amendment to go into effect.
  </p>


  <span class="inline-block py-1 px-2 rounded bg-indigo-50 text-orange-500 text-xs font-small tracking-widest">Limitations on state powers
  </span>
  <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Union and Concurrent Lists
  </h2>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">While the State List mentioned above provides powers for the States, there are two other lists in the Seventh Schedule that generally weaken them. These are the Union and Concurrent lists. The Union List is the counterpart to the State List, containing the areas of exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government, where the states are prohibited from legislating.Items on the Union List include the national defense, international relations, immigration, banking, and interstate commerce.
  </p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The final list is the Concurrent List which contains the topics on which both the Union and State-level governments may legislate on. These topics include courts and criminal law, unions, social security, and education.In general, when the Union and State laws on a Concurrent List item conflict, the Union-level laws prevail. The only way for the State-level law to override the national one is with the consent of the President, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.
    Additionally, any powers not on any of the three lists are reserved for the Union government and not for the states.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Appointment of governors
    </h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The Governor of each State is given the executive power of the respective State by the Constitution. These Governors are appointed directly by the President of the central government. Because the Prime Minister acts via the President, the Prime Minister is the one who chooses the Governors in practice. Once appointed, a Governor serves for a five year term or can be replaced by the President at any time, if asked to do so by the Prime Minister. Because the Union government can remove a Governor at any time, it is possible that Governors may act in a way the Union Government wants, to the detriment of their state, so that they can maintain their office. This has become a larger issue as the State Legislatures are often controlled by different parties than that of the Union Prime Minister, unlike the early years of the constitution. For example, Governors have used stalling tactics to delay giving their assent to legislation that the Union Government disapproves of.
    </p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">In general the influence of the Union on State politics via the Governor is limited, however, by the fact that the Governor must listen to the advice of the Chief Minister of the State who needs to command a majority in the State Legislature.[115] There are key areas where the Governor does not need to heed the advice of the Chief Minister. For example, the Governor can send a bill to President for consideration instead of signing it into law.

</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Perhaps the most direct power over the States is the Union's ability to unilaterally create new states out of territories or existing states and to modify and diminish the boundaries of existing states. To do so, Parliament must pass a simple law with no supermajority requirements. The States involved do not have a say on the outcome but the State Legislature must be asked to comment. The most recent state to be created was Telangana in 2014. More recently, Ladakh was created as a new Union Territory after being split off from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, and Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli were combined into a single Union Territory in 2020. The former was particularly opposed by some e.g. Arundhati Roy. In her opinion, Jammu and Kashmir was a full state, and the legislation creating Ladakh stripped the area of its status as a state and downgraded it to a Union Territory, allowing the Union Government to directly control it. This required no input from Jammu and Kashmir.

</span> 

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Main article: Judiciary of India
</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">While the states have separate legislative and executive branches, they share the judiciary with the Union government. This is different from other federal court systems, such as the United States, where state courts mainly apply state law and federal courts mainly apply federal law. Under the Indian constitution, the High Courts of the States are directly constituted by the national constitution. The constitution also allows states to set up lower courts under and controlled by the state's High Court. Cases heard at or appealed to the High Courts can be furter appealed to the Supreme Court of India in some cases. All cases, whether dealing with federal or state laws, move up the same judicial hierarchy, creating a system sometimes termed integrated federalism.

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">Flexibility</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">According to Granville Austin, "The Indian constitution is first and foremost a social document, and is aided by its Parts III & IV (Fundamental Rights & Directive Principles of State Policy, respectively) acting together, as its chief instruments and its conscience, in realising the goals set by it for all the people."[h] The constitution has deliberately been worded in generalities (not in vague terms) to ensure its flexibility.John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the United States, said that a constitution's "great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves." A document "intended to endure for ages to come", it must be interpreted not only based on the intention and understanding of its framers, but in the existing social and political context.

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">The "right to life" guaranteed under Article 21[A] has been expanded to include a number of human rights, including:
</h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~the right to a speedy trial;
  
 
  
 
  </h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~the right to water;</h2>
<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~the right to earn a livelihood,</h2>

<h2 class="sm:text-1xl text-1xl title-font font-small text-pink-600 mt-4 mb-4">~the right to education.</h2>



<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 mt-4 mb-4">At the conclusion of his book, Making of India's Constitution, retired Supreme Court Justice Hans Raj Khanna wrote:
</h2>

<h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-black-900 mt-4 mb-4">"If the Indian constitution is our heritage bequeathed to us by our founding fathers, no less are we, the people of India, the trustees and custodians of the values which pulsate within its provisions! A constitution is not a parchment of paper, it is a way of life and has to be lived up to. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty and in the final analysis, its only keepers are the people."</h2>
