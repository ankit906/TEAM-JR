                  <h1 class="title-font text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-3">CAPT.VIKRAM BATRA</h1>
                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-5">Captain Vikram Batra was born on 9th September 1974 and hailed from Bandla Gaon in Palampur district of Himachal Pradesh. Son of Shri Girdhari Lal Batra and Smt Kamal Kanta, Capt Vikram Batra received his primary education from D.A.V Public School, Palampur and then completed his senior secondary education from Kendriya Vidyalaya Palampur. After passing his second PU in 1992, he got admitted in D.A.V College in Chandigarh. While in college Capt Batra joined NCC and was awarded the best NCC Cadet (Air Wing) in the North Zone.Right from his younger days, he was fearless and bold and ever-ready to offer help to anyone in need. His helping nature coupled with pleasing manners made him likable to anyone who came in contact with him. Besides being good in academics, he took keen interest in sports too and specially excelled in table tennis. While growing up he was greatly influenced by the inspirational stories of the “Param Vir Chakra” awardees. As a young boy he would watch the TV serial “Param Vir Chakra” regularly and thereafter often discuss in detail their stories of courage and gallantry with his brother. Though he got selected to join the Merchant Navy, he knew his calling and had made up his mind to follow his dream of donning the Army uniform.Consequently he got through the Combined Defence Services Examination and got selected to join the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun in 1994. He joined the Jessore Company of Manekshaw Battalion and was commissioned into 13 JAK Rifles, an infantry Regiment well known for its intrepid soldiers and numerous battle exploits.  After being commissioned, he got posted to Sopore in Baramulla district of J&K as his first assignment. By April 1999, his unit had completed its field tenure  and was preparing to move to its peace location. But the detection of large scale intrusion by the Pakistani forces in Kargil sector in early May 1999 changed the operational scenario and the unit’s move to its peace location was cancelled.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-5">J. Robert Oppenheimer, in full Julius Robert Oppenheimer, (born April 22, 1904, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 18, 1967, Princeton, New Jersey), American theoretical physicist and science administrator, noted as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory (1943–45) during development of the atomic bomb and as director of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1947–66). Accusations of disloyalty led to a government hearing that resulted in the loss of his security clearance and of his position as adviser to the highest echelons of the U.S. government. The case became a cause célèbre in the world of science because of its implications concerning political and moral issues relating to the role of scientists in government.</p>
